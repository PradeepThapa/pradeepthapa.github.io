# Project: AI methods to analyse data related to electrical networks
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide insights and visualisations on the general profile of injuries, data profile of vegetation and animal or bird contact incidents and factors correlated to incidents involving ground fire.
* Built accurate machine learning multi-class classifiers to classify all categories of incidents using machine learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
* Development of the User Interface for the web application which serves as an interface for interacting with multi-class models and visualising data insights using the Flask framework.
* Models interpretability using LIME, ELI5 and Decision Boundary.
* Code reviews, mentoring of junior students and leading the project.
